              <p>
                In my second semester of freshman year, I got to be a part of a
                research stream called Phillips Virtual Culture. In it, we were
                tasked to take the Phillips Collection art museum in Washington
                D.C. and see how we could use technology to improve the museum
                experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                My project focused on improving one of the tedious tasks the
                museum had to perform, monitoring the humidity and temperature
                in each exhibit room.
              </p>
              <p>
                The IoT device consisted of a Raspberry Pi Zero, which had a
                temperature/humidity sensor attached to it. The Pi would
                communicate the data recorded by the sensor to Adafruit's IoT
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dashboard was made using Node.JS and Semantic UI. The front
                end was using Socket.IO for real time data updates from the IoT
                device. The backend was subscribed to Adafruit's IoT platform
                and broadcasted data to all connected clients whenever new data
                came in.

                At Bitcamp 2017, my team and I created Cardr. Cardr is an online
                e-wallet for your business cards. Its goal is to minimize the
                number of cards you have to carry around, but keeps all of your
                business cards, only a few clicks away.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you receive a business card, you open up Cardr and snap a
                picture of it. Cardr uses Google CV to analyze the card and
                retrieve all essential information from it such as phone numbers,
                email addresses, and names. After it has gathered all of the
                information it can from the card, it creates a virtual business
                card that stores all of that information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cardr also helps you organize your cards by linking them to
                specific events and lets you search for cards based on those
                events. Another way to query info is to use our companion Alexa
                skill, which you can query for either the phone number or email
                address of an individual, from their name or company.

                As my internship was winding down, the summer before my freshman
                year, I had some free time to learn something on my own. I took
                this time, to teach myself how to develop Amazon Alexa Skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Terrapin Nav allows you to ask how long it would take to walk
                between any two buildings at UMD's campus. I thought this would
                be very helpful for the beginning of the year as students would
                not know what would be the optimal time to leave for class.
                A quick shout to Terrapin Nav would return exactly how long the
                walk would take.
              </p>
              <p>
                The skill works by using <a class="text-muted" target="_blank"
                href="http://umd.io/">UMD's student run api</a>. This allowed
                me to get every building's exact latitude and longitude. From
                there, I fed the two sets of coordinates into Google's
                Geomatrix API, which spit it out navigation information between
                those two points, which I returned back to the user.

              <p>
                My first season of Major League Hacking hackathons was a blast. 
                I started with my first hackathon in November 2015 with HackRPI.
                From there, it's been a joy ride from exploring new campuses to
                meeting some really cool people. At the end of the 2016 season, 
                my friend <a class="text-highlighted" target="_blank" href="http://shahvineet98.github.io/">
                Vineet Shah</a> and I were invited to the season finale, MLH Prime.
              </p>
              <p>
                MLH Prime is a finale hackathon that is full of winners from 
                that season. For Prime, we built EzPill. EzPill is a smart pill 
                dispenser whose goal is to make managing medicine a breeze.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you get your prescription, you would empty your pills into 
                one of the two pill drums. Then, you would use our Android app to 
                scan the label on your prescription which would load all of your 
                prescription info into a calendar in our app. Next, you would be 
                prompted to select a time at which you want to EzPill to dispense
                your pills. When it came time to take your pills, it would dispense
                the correct dosage and shoot you a text message you to remind
                you to take your medicine.
              </p>
              <p>
                We keep track of how many pills were left through the companion 
                app and a web app that stored info about all of your prescriptions
                that you could glance at if you were out shopping and didn't know
                if you needed a refill. To build EzPill, we utilized a lot of 
                materials we found at Prime. We used cardboard, 3D printed parts,
                PVC, and servos for the physical device. The device was powered 
                by a raspberry pi which synced with the web app and android app 
                using Twilio's Sync platform.

                At Bitcamp 2016, my team and I created Fireberry Pi - A smart 
                smoke and gas detector. The idea spawned from the statistic that
                over 500 deaths occur from gas leaks in homes every year and a
                time when a smoke detector went off in my home, but no one was 
                there to respond. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Fireberry Pi fixes this issue by alerting all family members of 
                smoke or gas leak through a text message or alert in our companion
                Android app. You would also receive a picture of the room with 
                the text message so you can evaluate the situation on your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was built with a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino Uno. 
                The Uno was used as a micro controller which managed the input 
                from our gas/smoke sensor. The Rasperry Pi is what connects all 
                of our hardware to the web and Android app.

              <p>
                On the way to HackUMBC 2016, my team and I went over a lot of 
                potholes. We were annoyed but didn't think much of them. Once
                we got to the hackathon however, we decided to look into the 
                process of reporting potholes. We found out that in order for 
                the county to fix potholes, the public had to call in and report 
                them. We thought this was too much effort so we came up with 
                Lots of Holes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lots of holes is an Android app that you let run in the background
                while you drive. Once the app detects you go over a pothole 
                (Measurements from the accelerometer are monitored), a GPS flare
                is emitted to a Firebase DB. The DB then maps to a google maps 
                layer that can be shared with the county.
              </p>
              <p>
                The app works through crowdsourcing as the more people that 
                report a pothole, the higher priority the pothole gets assigned.
                This is also used to help remove anomalies.

                Terp Laundry is an Alexa skill that allows UMD students to check
                the status of washers and dryers in their dorm. I came up with the
                idea when a friend of mine complained that they had gone downstairs
                to the laundry room with their clothes, only to come back up after
                seeing that all the washers were currently in use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The skill works with any dorm at UMD, even with dorms that have
                multiple laundry rooms. It currently uses Selenium running
                PhantomJS as a headless browser to authenticate with UMD
                and scrape the laundry room stats from their website. I am
                currently talking with UMD to get access directly to the API
                that provides information about the Laundry Machines on campus.

              <p>
                Daemon Dash 2016 my team and I developed Galileo. Galileo is a
                schedule builder aimed at replacing Venus, our very old and
                clunky schedule generator, provided by UMD. Venus allows for
                no customization, preferences, or requests and spits out randomly
                generated permutations of the classes you want to sign up for.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to make the schedule generator smarter and cater more
                towards the students needs so we wrote our own version that includes
                filters and preferences. For example, students would be able to specify
                their dorms and get back a schedule that would be the most optimal in
                terms of walking.
